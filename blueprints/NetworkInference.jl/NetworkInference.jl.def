%apphelp specification
  Writes this container's specification to standard output.

  Optionally, if a SHA-256 checksum is given as the first command line
  argument, it will be checked against the full specification's checksum,
  exiting with a nonzero status if they deviate. In that case, the
  specification is not written.

  The specification is supposed to change if and only if the container
  definition changes. Other than that, its content is unstructured. This can
  be used as an indication to check if the container's behavior could have
  changed, but keep in mind that the behavior could also change if not all
  relevant dependencies are pinned correctly in the container definition.
